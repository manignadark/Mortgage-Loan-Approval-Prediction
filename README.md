# Mortgage-Loan-Approval-Prediction
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer‚Äôs mortgage loan will be approved or not based on financial and demographic details.


> üîπ Project Overview
> 
‚úÖ Problem Statement: Financial institutions process thousands of mortgage applications daily. Automating loan approval can reduce human errors and speed up the decision-making process.

‚úÖ Dataset: Publicly available datasets like Kaggle‚Äôs Loan Approval dataset.

‚úÖ ML Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost

‚úÖ Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Flask (for deployment).
